          This will make a 10' by 10' patch of sand into quicksand. It will
          be roughly 10' deep, if the sand goes that deep. The time needed
          to form the quicksand varies from 3 rounds to 20 minutes,
          depending on the amount of water nearby and the air moisture.
          Spells from Water Law or similar lists can cut the time
          considerably, though not under 3 rounds. (If the full time
          required is not spent, the fraction of time taken is proportional
          to the depth of the quicksand.) The water will evaporate according
          to local conditions.

          A sand storm is created in the area of effect. At it's most
          effective, when cast in a desert, visibility is 2', speed is
          reduced to a tenth, all missile attacks suffer a 100 penalty, all
          melee Attacks a 50 penalty and everyone in the area must make a RR
          vs 1st level or suffer an A Heat Critical. In other terrains, the
          effectiveness of the spell lessens: Half effect in plains, quarter
          effect in grasslands, hills or mountains, no effect in swamps or
          at sea. A Sheer Folly Spell Mastery might make the spell work in a
          snowfield, creating a Snow Storm with the same effects, except
          Cold instead of Heat Criticals.  Finally, if spell is cast in a
          natural sandstorm, the effect is at least doubled, the details are
          left to the GMs imagination.

          A mass of sand is compressed into sandstone. This is done by

          created by a lower level spell on this list within a minute after
          the target has reached the desired form, in which case it works on
          the entire structure. For Shelter, Burrow and the Dig spells, this

          grass dies, roots wither, etc. Larger growths and trees might get

          druid, nature deity or something similar, the entire area gets a

          a large mud hole.
